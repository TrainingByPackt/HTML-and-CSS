# HTML and CSS
This course will impart comprehensive knowledge of front-end web development to the reader. By the end of this course, you'll have a full understanding of how HTML & CSS are used together to produce accessible, well-coded websites that not only serve their purpose, but look beautiful too.

Regardless of your current knowledge of the subject, this course will start from the ground up. Given that you are able to use a computer, you are able to build your own website with the theoretical knowledge and practical applications explained here.

Newcomers to these technologies gain the knowledge required to pursue careers in the industry, or build their own website. Those with a level of knowledge in this area will be given an all-encompassing overview of HTML and CSS, valuable further reading, and a cemented knowledge of how markup languages and stylesheets can be used to their fullest potential.
